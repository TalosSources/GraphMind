# GraphMind
A noteTaking/MindMapping application using a graph structure.

This can be viewed as an open-source alternative to apps like TheBrain

## Features
 * One can create nodes, which can contain a name, some text and an url
 * Nodes can be linked together, and several relationship types exist offering some structuration
 * A GUI is offered to naviguate the graph, with a search feature
 * There's a simple graphical physically based interactive visualisation of a node and its neighbours
 * One can save and load the graph to a file, and the file format is a JSON compatible with TheBrain export files.
 * One can BreadthFirstSearch between 2 nodes, finding the closest path between 2 nodes, but there's no GUI integration for that yet

## Running
This is a java application, that can be run with the JSON and the JavaFX libraries.
