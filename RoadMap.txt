Main stuff to do :
-A tool to read the json files [DONE]
-A bunch of analysis tools : Shortest path, node centrality, spanning tree, other interesting stuff.
-A graphical interface
-A tool to read and write saves files in my own format (eventually) [DONE]

All of those steps seem accessible with my knowledge, however they will all take a lotta time.

Little Stuff to do :
-add the missing or locked features : multiple urls, maybe multiple notes, stuff like that
-really clean out the drawGraph stuff if motivation
-optimize search : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9636371/efficient-data-structure-for-substring-search

In notepad : change the encoding from UTF-8 BOM to UTF-8.
Ideally I would want to do that automatically

List of features that should be available in the client :
-See a thought, its text + url, children, parents and siblings
-Link 2 thoughts together, with different bound types, and unlink them too
    --> In fact we can choose between 4 states : parent-child, child-parent, siblings, and unrelated.
-navigate from a thought to others
-search thoughts by name
-load and save graph
-perform analytics

The save tool : It would have a button to load a save, that would read json files from a directory inputted by the user,
that should work with both external jsons and the ones we write. We therefore would also have a button to write a json,
which would write in a format where the only available informations would be the one needed directly by this program.

What can 2 thoughts be? -> They have to choose one between siblings, parent-child and child-parent. But any of those
3 relationships can work with a one-common-parent relationship. Therefore, we need to check that in childrenOfParents.
