Main stuff to do :
-A tool to read the json files
-A bunch of analysis tools : Shortest path, node centrality, spanning tree, other interesting stuff.
-A graphical interface
-A tool to read and write saves files in my own format (eventually)

All of those steps seem accessible with my knowledge, however they will all take a lotta time.
