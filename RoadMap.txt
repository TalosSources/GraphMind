Main stuff to do :
-A tool to read the json files
-A bunch of analysis tools : Shortest path, node centrality, spanning tree, other interesting stuff.
-A graphical interface
-A tool to read and write saves files in my own format (eventually)

All of those steps seem accessible with my knowledge, however they will all take a lotta time.

Little Stuff to do :
-add the missing or locked features : multiple urls, maybe multiple notes, stuff like that

In notepad : change the encoding from UTF-8 BOM to UTF-8.
Ideally I would want to do that automatically

The save tool : It would have a button to load a save, that would read json files from a directory inputted by the user,
that should work with both external jsons and the one we write. We therefore would also have a button to write a json,
which would write in a format where the only available informations would be the one needed directly by this program.
