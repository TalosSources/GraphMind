Main stuff to do :
-A tool to read the json files
-A bunch of analysis tools : Shortest path, node centrality, spanning tree, other interesting stuff.
-A graphical interface
-A tool to read and write saves files in my own format (eventually)

All of those steps seem accessible with my knowledge, however they will all take a lotta time.

Little Stuff to do :
-Filter out forgotten thoughts, maybe private thoughts too
-Filter out the weird corporate tutorials

In notepad : change the encoding from UTF-8 BOM to UTF-8.
Ideally I would want to do that automatically
